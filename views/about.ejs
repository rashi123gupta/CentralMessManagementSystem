                                Inspired by the potential to improve campus life, we set out to create a smarter 
                                mess management system. Late nights and countless brainstorming 
                                sessions led to the development of a user-friendly system that 
                                streamlined meal planning and billing for students and staff alike. What 
                                started as a small project for our college soon grew into a versatile 
                                solution used across campuses and centralized facilities. Today, our 
                                system is a trusted tool, making mess management simple, efficient, 
                                and hassle-free.
